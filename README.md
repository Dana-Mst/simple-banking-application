# Simple Banking Application

## Project tasks

You are tasked with creating a simple banking application that will handle accounts for customers.  The target is functionality wise a MVP solution for handling the current account balance.  REST/JSON API that allows for the following:

- Opening accounts (creating new accounts)

- Depositing amount to account - Withdrawing amount from account

- Transferring amount between accounts - Requesting the current balance of account

###Some additional notes:

- should be a spring/spring-boot application.

- Some storage is required, an embedded SQL sounds like it'll be enough.

- Transaction management will probably be required and/or making sure simultaneous requests for the same account are handled properly.

- Don't spend too much time on this, focus on the important things:

- Traceability and historical data, for instance, is not really a requirement. 

- Just **keeping track of the current balance associated with an account** is fine for this **MVP**.
